# Mandelbrot Set

A visualization of the [Mandelbrot set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). The app will show a window with visualization of the manselbrot set (as in the picture below). and using mouse clicks to zoom in (left button) and out (right button)

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 2.8
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* OpenCV >= 4.1
  * The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `make build`
3. Run the program ` build/mandelbrot `

> use mouse to zoom

##  Overview of code structure

the code is seperated in two folders include for Header files that can be used from other apps and src for cpp filles 

the code uses OOP and consist of three classes:
* Window in window.h : defines a utility class Window which is helpfull for window representation and manipulation.
* Graphics in graphics.h/ graphics.cpp: uses OpenCV to display the image generated by Mandelbrot class and listens for maouse events for zooming .
* Mandelbrot in mandelbrot.h/ mandelbrot.cpp : create the mandelbrot set for given
window

## Rubric

### Loops, Functions, I/O

|CRITERIA | MET SPECIFICATIONS|
|---------|:------------|
|The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.| for and while loops are used as in `mandelbrot.cpp:22,33`. functions are used to organization and modularity as `mandelbrot.cpp:18,30`|
|The project accepts user input and processes the input.| The app get input as mouse events `graphics.cpp:63`|

### Object Oriented Programming


|CRITERIA | MET SPECIFICATIONS|
|---------|:------------|
|The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.| uses classes as in `graphics.h, window.h`|
|Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.| uses appropriate access specifiers as in `mandelbrot.h:12,19`. |
|Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.| done as in Graphics constructor `graphics.cpp:48-51`|
|Classes encapsulate behavior.| the three classes implements encapsulation as in `mandlebrot.h, graphics.h`|
|Templates generalize functions in the project.| class Window uses to generalize the class and its members `Window.h:4`|

### Memory Management

|CRITERIA | MET SPECIFICATIONS|
|---------|:------------|
|The project makes use of references in function declarations.| defines two reference variable `manelbrot.h:20,21`.|
